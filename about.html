        <h1>Our team</h1>
        <p>Hello, I'm Denali Elsley, and I'm the owner of bay area pet boarding. I have been fostering and taking care of pets for over 5 years and have encountered many types of pets, from dogs and cats to fish. With the help of my family, I founded Bay area pet boarding, so that even though I don't have a pet of my own, I can still take care of and have fun with them. I look forward to meeting you and your furry friend!</p>
