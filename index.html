    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <h3>Our team</h1>
    <p>Hello, I'm Denali Elsley, and I'm the owner of Bay Area Pet Boarding. I have been fostering and taking care of pets for over 5 years and have encountered many types of pets, from dogs and cats to fish. With the help of my family, I founded Bay area pet boarding, so that even though I don't have a pet of my own, I can still take care of and have fun with them. I look forward to meeting you and your furry friend!</p>
    <h3>Our mission</h1>
    <p>We create a safe and welcoming environment for all our animals.</p>
    <h3>Our values</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Safety: We aim to make sure that all our pets are cared for in a supervised environment.</li>
      <li>Personalized care: We understand that all pets have their own needs, and aim to tailor their experience to their needs.</li>
      <li>Joy: We nurture not just the physical but the emotional health of our animals.</li>
    </ol>
